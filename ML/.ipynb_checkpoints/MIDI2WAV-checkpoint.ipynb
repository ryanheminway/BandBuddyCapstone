    "FluidSynth is a cross-platform Software Synthesizer ( https://github.com/FluidSynth/fluidsynth ). It has a standalone executable that can run on Linux or Windows, and can synthesize a MIDI file to raw audio. It takes in a SoundFont file which acts as a soundpack, providing sounds for each instrument channel. Swapping the SoundFont file allows the MIDI to get synthesize with different instrument sounds. This accomplishes both of our goals set above. \n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the above, I think we can install FluidSynth to our local linux environment on the Pi and call it directly. The command-line API returns raw audio (NOT WAV). As far as I know, this is fine, since we will just be directing the audio to output after that(?). \n",
    "\n",
    "The following code demonstrates using pyFluidSynth, which is a set of python bindings for the FluidSynth program. For the following code to work, you need to have pyFluidSynth installed in your python environment (should be set if you are using the BB environment included in our github repo) AND you need to have the FluidSynth dlls in the same folder as this notebook. You can download them here https://github.com/FluidSynth/fluidsynth/releases/tag/v2.1.6. This has everything for the actual executable, but we only need the DLLs because the pyFluidsynth library expects them. So I personally copied `bin/*.dll` to this local folder (BandBuddy/ML/) to get it to work. Everything else you can delete. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since we likely will just install FluidSynth directly, this is just a sandbox to play around with without having to mess with docker or running on the Pi.\n",
